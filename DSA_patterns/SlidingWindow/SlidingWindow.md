# Sliding Window

Problem type it solves :
* Sliding Window is used when you need to examine contiguous (continuous) parts of an array/string.

Examples:
1. Longest subarray with something
2. Smallest subarray that meets a condition
3. Count subarrays with specific properties
4. Maximum/minimum sum of any window of size K

### Why do we need Sliding Window?

* Without sliding window / Brute force approach:  `Check all possible subarrays → O(n²) time.`

* Sliding window approach:
    * Instead of recomputing the whole subarray every time, we "slide" from left to right and efficiently update the answer → O(n) time.

### Idea

We maintain a window defined by two pointers:
* **left** (start of window) and **right** (end of window)
* As right moves forward: we expand window
* if window becomes invalid, we shrink window by moving left
* You do **NOT recalculate from scratch**. You simply update the old sum.

### Two major types of sliding windows
* Type 1: **Fixed**-size window. Window size = constant (K).

* Type 2: **Variable**-size window. Window size changes based on condition.

`This is the pattern:  expand → break condition → shrink → restore validity → continue`

🔑 How to identify Sliding Window problems
* Look for these keywords in a problem statement:
* subarray / substring
* contiguous
* at most K
* longest / shortest
* sum / average
* "without repeating"
* "with K distinct"
* If it requires checking every possible continuous segment, sliding window is the right tool.

## Step-by-Step Logic Template

```
left = 0                                             // start of window
for right in range(len(arr)):                        //right end of window

    include arr[right] into window                   //Expand by moving right

    while window becomes invalid:
         remove arr[left]                            //Shrink by moving left
         left++

    update answer (if needed)
```
