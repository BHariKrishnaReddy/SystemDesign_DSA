This repository contains notes created alongside my learning and understanding of:
* System Design
* Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
* APIs

These notes are primarily for learning and revision purposes.
AI tools were used selectively to save time, not to replace understanding.
Several topics are still pending and incomplete.
If you find this repository useful and would like to contribute, feel free to raise a Pull Request (PR).
Contributions, corrections, and improvements are welcome.
