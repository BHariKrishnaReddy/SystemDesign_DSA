This repository contains notes created alongside my learning and understanding of:
* [System Design](https://github.com/BHariKrishnaReddy/SystemDesign_DSA/tree/main/System%20Design)
    - [Design Patterns](https://github.com/BHariKrishnaReddy/SystemDesign_DSA/blob/main/System%20Design/Design-Patterns.md) - [Coursera Certification](https://coursera.org/share/bd23730cfbd42d35d604678595caef4f)
    * Gorking SD Interviews
* Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
* APIs

These notes are primarily for learning and revision purposes.
AI tools were used selectively to save time, not to replace understanding.
Several topics are still pending and incomplete.
